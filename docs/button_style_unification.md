# Problem
There are multiple button styles. Some have hover effects, some have click effects, some are black background, some are light background. 

# Goal
Create a uniform button style for the app. 

# Plan
## Steps
- Find all buttons in the app
- Align on a canonical button by prototyping in the /style_guide and getting feedback from user. Use existing buttons as a starting point.
- Create a button partial with inputs necessary to meet existing use cases in the app
- Document the button partial in the design_system.md
- Replace all buttons with the new canonical button.
