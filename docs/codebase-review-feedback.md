## Prioritized Action Items

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Do First) âœ… COMPLETED
1. âœ… **Remove incomplete password reset system** - It's broken and references non-existent code
2. âœ… **Remove future date validation in HabitEntry** - YAGNI: validation causes timezone issues and serves no real purpose
3. âœ… **Add missing box styles (0-9) and x_styles (0-9) to HabitEntry enum** - Component library has 10 of each, model now matches
4. âœ… **Update CLAUDE.md with code standards**:
   - No compound unless statements
   - No useless variable assignments in tests
   - Update TDD agents with same standards

### Priority 2: Model Improvements âœ… COMPLETED
5. âœ… **Remove random check_type assignment from Habit** - Should be explicit user choice
6. âœ… **Extract Habit.copy_from_previous_month to HabitCopyService**
7. âœ… **Add dependent: :destroy to habit_entries association**
8. âœ… **Remove/increase DailyReflection content length limit**
9. âœ… **Add email validations to User model**
10. âœ… **Remove unnecessary helper methods or convert to scopes in User**
11. âœ… **Clarify or remove `active` field in Habit**
12. âœ… **Refactor compound unless statements in HabitEntry**

### Priority 3: Test Coverage âœ… COMPLETED
13. âœ… **Write comprehensive tests for User model** - Currently has ZERO tests
14. âœ… **Write tests for SessionsController** - 9 comprehensive tests added
15. âœ… **Clean up useless variable assignments in all tests**

### Priority 4: UI/UX
16. **Style the login form** - Currently unstyled, doesn't match design system
17. **Apply Japanese journal aesthetic to all views**

### Priority 5: Future Planning
18. **Plan OAuth integration** for Google, GitHub, etc.
19. **Plan core controllers** for Phase 2 (Habits, HabitEntries, DailyReflections)
20. **Consider removing system test gems** if not using them

## Detailed File-by-File Feedback

### 1. app/models/user.rb

**Feedback:**
- **OAuth Integration**: Plan to support Google, GitHub, and other OAuth providers in the future
- **Helper Methods**: Question whether `habits_for_month`, `reflections_for_month`, and `reflection_for_date` are necessary - might be better as scopes or removed if not used
- **Missing Tests**: Model lacks unit tests for these helper methods
- **Missing Validations**: No email validation (format, presence, uniqueness)

**Action Items:**
- [x] Add email validations (presence, uniqueness, format)
- [x] Write unit tests for User model
- [x] Consider removing or converting helper methods to scopes
- [ ] Plan OAuth integration architecture for future

### 2. app/models/habit.rb

**Feedback:**
- **Active field purpose**: Question what the `active` field is for - needs clarification or removal if unused
- **Remove random check_type assignment**: Should be set explicitly when creating habit (via console or UI), not randomly
- **Extract to service class**: `copy_from_previous_month` should be in a `HabitCopyService` class, not in the model
- **Missing association option**: Should add `dependent: :destroy` to `has_many :habit_entries`

**Action Items:**
- [x] Remove `before_create :assign_random_check_type` callback
- [x] Remove random assignment logic from model
- [x] Create `HabitCopyService` class and move copy logic there
- [x] Add `dependent: :destroy` to habit_entries association
- [x] Clarify purpose of `active` field or remove if unused
- [x] Update tests to reflect removal of random assignment

### 3. app/models/habit_entry.rb

**Feedback:**
- **Missing box styles**: Only 5 box styles in enum but there should be 10 (matching the style guide components)
- **Unnecessary else clause**: Since habits should always have a check_type, the else clause in `random_check_style` is unnecessary
- **Compound unless antipattern**: `return unless completed? && habit.present?` is hard to read - should be avoided
- **Unnecessary validation**: Future date validation causes timezone issues and serves no real purpose (YAGNI)
- **Test code quality**: Tests have useless variable assignments that should be removed (needs CLAUDE.md update)
- **Random style is good**: The randomness mimics hand-written journals and should stay - boxes vary, X marks vary within their type

**Action Items:**
- [x] Add box_style_0 through box_style_9 to checkbox_style enum (zero-indexed)
- [x] Remove unnecessary else clause in random_check_style
- [x] Refactor compound unless statements to be more readable
- [x] Remove future date validation entirely (YAGNI)
- [x] Add compound unless antipattern note to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Add "no useless variable assignments" to CLAUDE.md and TDD agents
- [x] Clean up tests to remove useless variable assignments

### 4. app/models/daily_reflection.rb

**Feedback:**
- **Content length limit**: 255 characters seems too restrictive - why have a max length at all?
- **Useless test assignments**: Tests have useless variable assignments that should be removed
- **YAGNI**: `has_content?` method should be removed unless actively used (just use `content?` or `content.present?` directly)

**Action Items:**
- [x] Remove or significantly increase MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH (consider removing validation entirely)
- [x] Remove `has_content?` method unless it's actually used somewhere
- [x] Clean up tests to remove useless variable assignments

### 5. app/controllers/application_controller.rb

**Feedback:**
- **Browser restrictions**: `allow_browser versions: :modern` might be too restrictive for a habit tracker
- Clean and minimal implementation

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Evaluate if browser restrictions are necessary

### 6. app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb

**Feedback:**
- Good rate limiting implementation
- Missing tests
- Clean Rails 8 pattern

**Action Items:**
- [x] Add controller tests

### 7. app/controllers/passwords_controller.rb

**Feedback:**
- **Incomplete implementation**: References `PasswordsMailer` that doesn't exist
- **Missing model methods**: Uses `find_by_password_reset_token!` which isn't implemented
- **No email integration**: Would need ActionMailer setup, email provider, etc.
- **Should remove for now**: Password reset is a lower priority feature

**Action Items:**
- [x] Remove PasswordsController entirely
- [x] Remove password reset routes
- [x] Remove password reset views
- [x] Add password reset to future features list

### 8. app/controllers/style_guide_controller.rb

**Feedback:**
- Clean and simple
- Has tests
- Good for development

### General Controller Observations

**Missing Core Controllers:**
- No HabitsController yet (Phase 2 in plan)
- No HabitEntriesController yet 
- No DailyReflectionsController yet

**Action Items:**
- [x] Remove incomplete password reset system
- [ ] Plan core controllers for Phase 2

### 9. app/views/

**Layout (application.html.erb):**
- Good mobile web app setup
- PWA manifest ready but commented out
- Clean and minimal

**Style Guide Views:**
- Comprehensive checkbox component library
- 10 box variations confirmed (matching our earlier discussion)
- Well-organized partials
- Good separation between style_guide/ and checkboxes/ directories

**Auth Views (sessions, passwords):**
- **Completely unstyled**: Just basic HTML forms with inline styles for flash messages
- **Password reset views need removal**: Part of incomplete feature
- **No design system applied**: Auth forms don't match the Japanese journal aesthetic

**Missing Views:**
- No HabitsController views
- No HabitEntriesController views 
- No DailyReflectionsController views
- No main application UI

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Style the login form with Japanese journal aesthetic
- [x] Remove password reset views
- [ ] Plan main application views for Phase 2
- [ ] Apply design system to all user-facing views

### 10. Tests

**Model Tests:**
- **User**: NO TESTS AT ALL - completely empty test file
- **Habit**: 30 tests, good coverage but has useless variable assignments
- **HabitEntry**: 34 tests, extensive coverage but has useless variable assignments  
- **DailyReflection**: 21 tests, good coverage but has useless variable assignments

**Controller Tests:**
- **StyleGuideController**: Has basic tests
- **SessionsController**: NO TESTS
- **PasswordsController**: NO TESTS (to be removed anyway)

**Common Issues:**
- Useless variable assignments throughout (e.g., `reflection1 = create(...)` when reflection1 is never used)
- Missing tests for User model entirely
- Missing tests for authentication controllers

**Action Items:**
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for User model
- [x] Write tests for SessionsController
- [x] Clean up all useless variable assignments in existing tests
- [x] Add this pattern to CLAUDE.md and TDD agents

### 11. Configuration

**Routes:**
- Has password routes that need removal
- Root route points to style guide (should eventually be login or main app)
- PWA routes commented out but ready

**Gemfile:**
- Good modern Rails 8 setup
- Has solid_cache, solid_queue, solid_cable ready
- Includes claude-on-rails gem
- Has Kamal for deployment
- Includes test gems (capybara, selenium) for system tests we're not using

**Action Items:**
- [x] Remove password routes
- [ ] Update root route when main app is built
- [ ] Consider removing system test gems if not using them
